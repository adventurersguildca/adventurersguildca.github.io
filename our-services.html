		<h3>Share the Story</h3>
		<p>If the story doesn't get out in the form of video, photos or writing, no one else can see it, learn from it, be inspired by it. That doesn't mean we’re on Facebook, Instagram, Tweet and YouTube every moment of every adventure but most adventures produce good lessons and good stories. Let’s share them.</p>
		<div style="height:20px;"></div>

		<h3>Trip Reports</h3>
		<p>The most accurate information about trails and conditions come from the folks that were just out there. Good trip reports are a gold mine of information when you're planning a trip. We document every single trip we do, even if it's just a few quick details about the trail, photos and sketches.</p>
		<div style="height:20px;"></div>

		<h3>Gear Reviews</h3>
		<p>Gear can make or break a trip. Comfortable gear makes for a comfortable trip. But with all the gear out there which ones do you go with? Browse our trip reports when you're looking for new gear and you'll find the stuff that we like the best.</p>
