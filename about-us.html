		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>We are a community of adventurers seeking to  broaden our horizons, push our limits, and instil more grit into everything we do. We dream, we dare, and we grow.</p>
		<p>The Guild was designed to give you an introduction into adventure travel including overland and water expeditions </p>
		<p>The aim is to share the benefits of adventure. Completing adventures enables us to reach higher levels of achievement in all realms of life.</p>
		<p>The Adventurers Guild  is about helping you, the  adventurer, get out into the world and see things that most people do not get to see and do things that very few ever get to do.  We are also about helping some of the people you will get know, such as an orphanage in the Baja, Mexico. </p>
		<p>The Guild is not for the ordinary traveller wanting to get from A to B directly and in comfort.  We want to find new paths, explore, and experience the expedition as much as the destination. The itinerary is deliberately vague as a big part of this adventure in general is the willingness to embrace uncertainty and the unknown –  it begins before we depart. As well as discussing the topics mentioned below, the adventure  is very pragmatic and so you will be learning whilst actually on the adventure, which is why this is so unique.  We take a very relaxed and informal approach.</p>

		<p>At the Adventurers Guild  our  concept is simple: to capture the emotion and experience of adventures and expeditions throughout the world… and to inspire others to join us</p>
		<p>The Guild was created to bring adventurers together.  We have discovered that there is so much that is extraordinary about the places we travel, from the landscape, wildlife, culture and history that is unique to every destination. We enjoy the people.  We seek to immerse ourselves in the local culture and to avoid trite tourist destinations and to rather seek the seldom followed path. </p>
		<p>The Guild seeks to fill this gap by providing hand selected expeditions, like our Adventure Motorcycle Expedition to Baja Mexico,  Alaska, and Utah, and our Caribbean Sailing Flotilla, run by our guides with decades of experience. </p>
		<p>Currently on the site you’ll find off-road motorcycle expeditions to Baja Mexico, New Zealand, Utah and the Cascades WA and Kettle Valley, BC.  For more eye-candy and adventure, there’s also the AG blog.</p>
